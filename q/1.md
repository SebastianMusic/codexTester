###### Question ######
What are the key steps in the TCP three-way handshake process?

###### Important points to remember ######
- SYN: Client initiates connection by sending SYN packet.
- SYN-ACK: Server responds with SYN-ACK packet.
- ACK: Client acknowledges with ACK packet.
- This establishes a full duplex TCP connection.
- Vulnerabilities: SYN flood attack risk during handshake.
